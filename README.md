# Inequality dynamics

Evolutionary and economic process are essentially temporary process.
For temporary process it is import to distinguish at least between additive and multiplicative process. 
In evolutionary theory everyone is taught the fact that lineage growth is a multiplicative and noisy process: a sequence of survival and reproductive probabilities.
This had huge consecuences that had been discused [here](link al otro post)
Today we will discuss inequality in economic dynamics, so we are interested in economic process.

Poor peoples lives inside additive regimes.
At best, they can decide between a job that offers $2,000 per month, and another that offers $1,250 per fortnight (i.e. 15 days).
Not-poor people may have access also to a muliplicative regimes.
With the money saved at the end of the month, they can choice between two savings accounts, one that pays 4% per year, the other 0.25% per month.
Additive earnings and multiplicative returns on investments are the two most common processes that change our wealth in economic process.
However they have different scales!
One grows linearly.
The other grows exponentially.

However they have different scales!
So, if we consider the overall growth of wealth of an entire population, as actually politicians do, only the multiplicative process will stand out. 



The additive process will lead to a linear growth of wealth, while the multiplicative process will lead to a exponential growth of wealth.
So if we 


So clearly comparing their numerical values has no physical meaning

For economic theory, the multiplicative dynamic 

Take the additive growth rate and the multiplicative growth rate, for instance. They have different dimensions! So clearly comparing their numerical values has no physical meaning

The ergodicity question is about whether the aggregate (the ensemble average) reflects what happens to the individual (over time).


 
We represent a real environment through a stochastic function
